# Flop-n-pop
This is the second official game that I've made. It is a lot better than the first one and this prototype was made in 7 hours! Enjoy!
# Version 1.0 The Fast Update!
This is the second version of my game that I've literally made in like 2 hours! Here are the changes:
- Added lightnings
- Fixing many bugs!

So I know it might be a small changelog but at least it was made quickly!

(Also GitHub doesn't allow me commit files over 25MB so I can just give the source code for now!)

Goodbye!
# Version 0.1 The (not quite) full release
This is the first official version of my game Flop-n-pop. And no this is not my idea and it isn't very original. But the main features (for now) are:
- Scoring system
- Main Menu
- Different types of balloons
- Lives = Balloons caught

Now there is also one other thing. Whenever you jump you lose a balloonl.

That is today's changelog. Feel free to try it and give me some feedback!

Goodbye!
